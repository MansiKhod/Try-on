1) **Virtual Clothing Try-On**

This is a Python-based project that allows users to upload a video of themselves and try on virtual clothing. The project detects the user's body pose and overlays selected shirts on the video in real-time, giving a preview of how the clothing will look on them.


2) **Features**

* Detects body pose from a video using the PoseModule.
* Overlays virtual shirts on the user's body based on pose landmarks.
* Allows users to change between different shirts using hand gestures.
* Real-time rendering of clothing on the video.


3) **Demo**

A user can upload their video, and the system overlays the selected shirt onto the body. Hand gestures allow changing the clothing on the screen.


4) **Tech Stack**

* Python: Core programming language used for development.
* OpenCV: For video processing and real-time rendering.
* cvzone: A computer vision library for easy image processing and interaction, used for pose detection and overlaying images.
* cvzone.PoseModule: For detecting body landmarks to place the virtual clothes correctly.
* Pose Detection: Utilizes cvzone.PoseModule to detect key body points (landmarks).
* NumPy: For array manipulation and image processing.


5) **Controls**

* Move your right hand to the left side to switch to the previous shirt.
* Move your left hand to the right side to switch to the next shirt.
* Press q to exit the application.


6) **Future Improvements**

* Add more clothing types, such as pants or accessories.
* Allow users to upload their own videos and images through a web interface.
* Improve pose detection accuracy for better fitting of virtual clothes.
